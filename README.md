This is the companion code for the data scientist blog project:
https://datalurker.wordpress.com/2020/03/08/covid-19-should-we-panic-and-when-will-it-end/

There are 3 datasets used in this project sourced from below:
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data

The data is downloaded as of 03/07/2020 CST

This analysis is aiming at answering following questions of interest:

1. How many phases of infections there are in the observed virus trasimission process? 
2. Does the virus transmit similarly in different areas/states?
3. How is the situation in China now at 3 months after the outbreak? Will it get cleared soon?  
4. How long it will take to see the panic outbreak in the US and when it will clear out?

This project follows the CRISP-DM process as domenstrated in the analysis flow, from business/data understanding, to data preparing/modeling, until results/deploy.
